/**
    RmlUi's System Interface.

    This class provides interfaces for Time, Translation and Logging.

    Time is the only required implementation.

    The default implemention of Translation doesn't translate anything

    The default implementation of logging logs Windows Debug Console,
    or Standard Error, depending on what platform you're using.
